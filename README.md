# 2048 Javscript Webapp

This is a re-make of the popular 2028 block puzzle game originally seen here: https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

I re-made the game using Javascript and JQuery libraries with some custom HTML/CSS styling.

To test the app, simply open index.html with any browser and make sure all the .js and styling files are in the same directory.
